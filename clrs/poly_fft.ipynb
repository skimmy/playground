    "This notebook contains ideas and insights regarding the chapter 30 of CLRS book *Polynomials and FFT*. We use part of the convetion of ``numpy`` library where polynomials are expressed in terms of their *coefficients* as a vector $\\mathbf{a} = (a_{n-1},a_{n-2},\\ldots,a_0)$ where $n-1$ is the *degree* of the polynomial. Notice that the coefficient are stored in the reverse order (*i.e.*, the first element of the array is the higher degree coefficient).\n",
