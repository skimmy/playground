    "\n",
    "This notebook starts exploring the branch of probability known as *first passage percolation (FPP)* with a particular attention to the computational aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start from a *lattice* $\\mathbb{Z}^d$. For clarity of exposition we will use $d=2$ most of the time, however we will try to make the exposition (and the code) as general as possible. A point on a lattice is a $d$-tuple of integers\n",

    "## Passage time\n",
    "The theory of percolation borrows ideas from physics. Each point of the lattice could be viewed as a container for some fluid, the fluid can flow from one container to the another that is one of its *neighbour*, the time needed for the whole fluid to transfer from one container to the other is called the **passage time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally let $P,Q\\in\\mathbb{Z}^d$ be two points of the lattice and let $e_{P,Q}$ be the *edge* between them (we deliberately use notation from graphs), then $\\tau_{e_{P,Q}}$ (or simply $\\tau_e$) is a real value called the passage time from $P$ to $Q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\Gamma$ is a *path* on the lattice made of the edges $e_1,e_2,\\ldots,e_n$, we define the passage time of $\\Gamma$ as the sum of the passage times of all its edges\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "T(\\Gamma) = \\sum_{e\\in\\Gamma}{\\tau_e} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\tau_{e_i}}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generalization to $\\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "\n",
    "One can view the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ as a grid of points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, thus it makes sense to ask whether the notion of passage time can be extended to the entire space $\\mathbb{R}^d$. A straightforward generalization assigns to each pair of points $\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ the "
